# NetQIR specification
Repository defining the NetQIR specification. In this repository we aim to specify and exemplify the NetQIR, an intermediate representation for distributed systems.

Quantum computing is a rapidly changing field where new technologies and demands are constantly appearing, requiring the software to adapt to them. One path that is
believed to be the future of quantum computing is distributed quantum computing, where several quantum processing units (QPUs) are connected to each other in order to allow more computational
power while avoiding problems of a single core architecture. This is the main motivation behind NetQIR, an intermediate representation for distributed systems
build on top of QIR. Te aim of this intermediate representation is to add communication directives to quantum programs writen in QIR.
